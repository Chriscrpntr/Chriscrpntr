I’m a Systems Integration Engineer who thrives on crafting custom solutions to streamline operations and breathe new life into outdated systems.
Whether it’s building a TCP-based data extraction tool from scratch or replacing a legacy FoxPro DOS system with a modern Python-based platform, I specialize in modernizing infrastructure, slashing inefficiencies, and integrating AI-driven tools for real-time insights.
